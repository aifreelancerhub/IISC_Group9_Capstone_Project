Its petroleum refinery\n-cum-petrochemicals complex in Jamnagar, India, produces gasoline, superior kero-\nsene oil and liquefied petroleum gas, among other products.  \n \n\u2022 In Q2FY25, RIL saw muted revenue growth (+0.2% YoY), driven by mixed perfor-\nmances of its operating segments.  \n\u2022 EBITDA margin contracted 30bps YoY to 18.8%, primarily owing to lower margin \nfor the oil -to-chemicals (O2C) segment led by decline in product margins. As a \nresult, Adj. PAT declined 9.4% YoY to Rs. 16,563cr.  \n\u2022 In the O2C segment, revenue grew 5.1% YoY to Rs. 155,580cr mainly due to high-\ner volume and improved domestic product placements. However, unfavourable \ndemand -supply dynamics led to a 50% decline in transportation fuel cracks and \nweakened downstream chemical deltas, resulting in a 300bps YoY decline in \nEBITDA margin for the segment to 8.0%  \n\u2022 Digital segment reported a 16.5% YoY growth in revenue to Rs. 38,055cr, driven \nby recent tariff hikes and the acceleration of home and digital services businesses.  \n\u2022 Retail revenue decline a marginal 1.1% YoY due to soft demand for fashion and \nlifestyle.

Insurance and regulations, particularly in r iskand \ncompliance, are also showing growth. Overall, BFSI in North America is performing well.\n\uf0d8The management acknowledged that challenges in the non -BFSI segments are more pronounced in North America, contributing to \nslower growth in that region.\n\uf0d8Europe region mirrored similar trends, with the banking and insurance sectors performing well. However, capital markets in th e U.K. are \nfacing challenges, which seem to be more client -specific than indicative of a broader trend.\n\uf0d8Management expresses optimism about the sustainability of growth in banking and insurance in the upcoming quarters .\nAI and Automation Trends\n\uf0d8Growing interest in Generative AI is boosting discussions on traditional AI and automation.\n\uf0d8Clients are investing in data insights and AI tools to enhance customer behavior understanding and marketing strategies.\n\uf0d8Significant investments in AI and Generative AI have surged over the past two years.\n\uf0d8There\u2019s increasing interest in applying Generative AI throughout the software development life cycle, including legacy migrat ion.\nCloud Strategy and Product Development\n\uf0d8Investments in cloud -based checkout solutions indicate a commitment to agility.\n\uf0d8TCS has implemented a modular, fully automated cloud -based system, integrating around 40 applications for end -to-end processes.\n\uf0d8Development of a cloud -native modular platform is underway, embedding Generative AI across the software development life cycle.\nCapital Allocation\n\uf0d8The capital allocation policy focuses on returning surplus cash flow to shareholders.\n\uf0d8The Board has proposed an interim dividend of INR 10 per share.\n\uf0d8Future decisions on buybacks or special dividends will consider stakeholder feedback.\nEmployee Headcount\n\uf0d8The company added 5,726 associates in Q2FY25, similar to the previous quarter, and is on track for planned special onboarding . \nHowever, the attrition rate was 12.3%, as TCS added 5,726 employees, marking the second consecutive quarter of net additions, with a \ntotal of 11,178 new hires in H1FY25.\n\uf0d8Recruitment for special international hires for FY26E has begun.\nMacro Environment\n\uf0d8Though the stability in the macro environment is fostering initial confidence, the risks associated with US economic slowdown and geo -\npolitical concerns are not adding sufficient confidence for sustained growth trajectory over the near term. \n\uf0d8No significant decline in demand has been noted, while deal durations have increased slightly.\n\uf0d8The current short -term freeze on discretionary spending is viewed as a response to market uncertainty, which is expected to ease in the \nmedium term.\nValuation and view:\nTCS Q2FY25revenue came inline with our estimates ;however, earnings were below expectations .The management highlighted the\nchallenges inmanufacturing, Life &Sciences, and consumer business inthe near term but expects improved discretionary spending and\ncapital investment with inflation easing out.The BFSI segment saw arecovery ,with BFSI North America and BFSI Europe showing decent\ngrowth .However, we expect that revenue and earnings inQ3FY25Ewill moderate due todelays indeal closure, weak seasonality, and\nclient -specific challenges .However, we strongly believe technology spending islikely topick updue torecent interest rate cuts and\nimprovements inmacroeconomic conditions .There are early signs ofimprovement inthe BFSI sector, and the management has\nhighlighted that the pipeline inthe BFSI vertical remains strong .Accordingly, wereaffirm our FY26EEPS ofINR 158.2and P/Emultiple of\n29.0x.Consequently, weretain our target price

business momentum was evident, particularly incredit growth, which\nslowed compared toindustry trends .However, the bank delivered better -than -expected earnings, largely due toasharp increase inother\nincome and ataxwrite -back following favorable ITAT orders .Retail segments, especially unsecured products, areshowing growth, but AXSB\niscautious due tosigns ofstress driven byindebtedness .The bank continues tofocus onpremium segments and maintains adisciplined\napproach toloan disbursements .While NIM saw aslight decline, operating performance remained strong, and disciplined cost management\nmoderated the impact ofsluggish credit growth .Overall, AXSB's results were buoyed bynon -core earnings and strategic provisions rather\nthan broad -based business growth .The bank's sustained investment intechnology, cybersecurity, and digital banking platforms, along with\nitsleadership inUPI and transaction banking, continues todrive fee income and operational efficiency .Key growth drivers include the\nexpansion ofitsBurgundy wealth management franchise, robust deposit growth under Project Triumph, and astrong presence inrural and\nMSME banking .AXSB's disciplined

Research | Q2FY25 results review  \n \nTitan Company  \nConsumer Staples & Discretionary  \n \n Relative underperformance to continue; Margin guidance cut  \nTitan's domestic jewellery business revenue growth had a strong revival (~25% YoY; LFL: 15% YoY) driven by improved \nindustry demand conditions (though likely to underperform peers) for gold jewellery due to customs duty cut while higher -\nvalue studded segment demand was under pressure due to global price uncertainty , leading to ~300bps (~ 30%) reduction in \nstudded share. This led to a material decline of ~270bps in normalised jewellery EBIT margin with management revising its \nguidance downwards to 11 -11.5% (vs 11. 5-12.5%  earlier). Further, current phase of formalisation gains accruing more to \ncompetition  (availability of growth capital) will likely continue to keep a check on revenue growth performance. Global price \nuncertainty in high -value studded segment is another headwind. We like management\u2019s preference of growth over margins  \nin the near  term . That said, both growth and margin are important for its valuations . HOLD .  \nStrong revival in revenue growth  led by customs duty reduction  \nTitan 's Q2FY25 revenue / GP / EBITDA / recurring PAT growth (YoY) were 24 / \n-2 / -16 / -25 (%). Jewellery revenue grew by ~27% YoY driven by 15% LFL \ngrowth in secondary as customs duty cut led to surge in demand for gold \njewellery with correction in prices , while large -size solitaire were impacted due \nto price uncertainty ; overall studded segment ha d a decent growth (12% YoY).  \nOther key highlights : (1) Buyer growth during the quarter was  ~12% YoY . (2) \nASP  grew 10% YoY. (3) Studded revenue share dipped by 300bps YoY to 30% . \n(4) CaratLane continues to deliver healthy growth trends with revenue of \nINR8 .3bn (+28% YoY) with 7% EBIT margin.  \nRetail expansion continues to be healthy with 20% YoY growth.  It added 11 \nstores in Tanishq (EOP 502), 12 Mia stores (EOP:209), 23 CaratLane stores \n(EOP: 286) and 1 Zoya stores (EOP: 12).   \nRevenue from watches grew 19%  YoY led by outperformance in the analog \nsegment (26% YoY, ~88% contribution). In analog watches, Fastrack brand \nreported ~18% YoY growth while Titan brand grew 32% YoY and Helios grew \n43% YoY (L2L retail growth of 28%). Titan World reported 15% YoY second ary \nretail revenue growth led by 11% YoY L2L. Wearable segment \nunderperformed: 13% decline in revenue growth impacted by continuously \nfalling average selling price. It added 34 new stores in 2QFY25 taking the total \nEBO count to 1,171.  \n \n \n Financial Summary  \nY/E March  (INR mn )     FY23A  FY24A  FY25E  FY26E  \nNet Revenue  3,83,670  4,69,680  5,59,731  6,57,827  \nEBITDA  48,790  52,920  53,676  72,307  \nEBITDA Margin (%)  12.7  11.3  9.6 11.0  \nNet Profit  32,740  34,690  30,716  44,330  \nEPS ( INR) 36.9  39.1  34.6  49.9  \nEPS % Chg YoY  45.4  6.0 (11.5)  44.3  \nP/E (x)  87.6  82.7  93.4  64.7  \nEV/EBITDA (x)  59.0  55.4  54.5  39.8  \nRoCE (%)  27.3  22.6  18.9  23.6  \nRoE (%)  30.8  32.6  29.3  33.5  \n   \nManoj Menon  \nmanoj.menon@icicisecurities.com  \n+91 22 6807 7209  \n \nKaran Bhuwania  \nkaran.bhuwania@icicisecurities.com  \n \nAkshay Krishnan  \nakshay.krishnan@icicisecurities.com  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \nMarket Data  \nMarket Cap (INR)  2,868bn                                                   \nMarket Cap (USD)  34,100mn  \nBloomberg Code  TTAN IN  \nReuters Code  TITN.BO  \n52-week Range (INR)  3,887  /3,056  \nFree Float (%)  47.0 \nADTV -3M (mn) (USD)  49.6 \n \n \nPrice Performance (%)  3m 6m 12m  \nAbsolute  (4.3)  (8.6)  (1.4)  \nRelative to Sensex  (5.2)  (16.2)  (24.8)  \n \n \nESG Score  2023  2024  Change  \nESG score  74.0 69.4 (4.6) \nEnvironment  56.9  56.9  0.0 \nSocial  75.3  56.6  (18.7 ) \nGovernance  81.0  84.9  3.9 \nNote  - Score ranges from 0 - 100 with a higher \nnumber indicating a higher ESG score.  \nSource: SES ESG, I -sec research  \n \n \n \nEarnings Revisions (%)  FY25 E FY26E \nRevenue  1.4 1.4 \nEBITDA  (12.8)  (1.3)  \nEPS (22.7 ) (9.6) \n \n \nPrevious Reports  \n04-08-2024: Q1FY25 results review  \n02-06-2024:  Company Update      \n \n   \n Titan Company  | Q2FY25 results review  | 06 November 2024  \nIndia | Equity Research  2 \nEyewear business revenue grew 7% YoY led by double -digit volume growth in frames \nand lenses , while sunglasses witnessed pressure due to seasonality. Titan Eye Plus \nsecondary sales reported 3% YoY growth L2L. Revenue from international brand grew \n~53% YoY. It has added 3 net new stores during the quarter (EOP: 9 10 stores).    \nJewellery EBIT margin guidance revised downwards   \nJewellery segment normalised EBIT margin declined ~270 bps YoY to 11.4% due to \ninferior mix: 1) studded share declined ~300bps YoY and 2) lower demand in solitaire \nsegment . Reported EBIT margin declined by 480bps YoY to 8. 3% in due to one -off \nimpact on realisations  due to customs duty reduction  (INR 2.9bn) . EBIT margin has \nimproved marginally by 20bps YoY in Watches segment but dipped sharply by 300 \nbps YoY in Eyecare.  \nManagement has revised its Jewellery EBITDA margin gui dance downwards to 11 -\n11.5% (normalized) for FY25 vs  its previous guidance of 11.5 -12.5%.  Though it expects \nmargin to recover to its earlier guidance of 11.5 -12.5% post FY25, it awaits couple of \nquarter s to provide a guidance post FY25.  As per management, this is largely due to \ninferior mix . It further highlighted one -time impact of ~INR 2.8bn due to cut in customs \nduty in Q3FY25.  \nValuation and risks  \nWe have cut our earnings estimates by ~23%/~10% for FY25E /26E largely due to lower \nEBIT margin expectations in jewellery segment ; modelling revenue / EBITDA / PAT \nCAGR of 18 / 17 / 13 (%) over FY24 -26E. Maintain HOLD  with a DCF -based revised \ntarget price of INR 3, 100 (vs INR 3,500 previously). Key upside risk is lower competitive \nactivity. Key downside risk is worsening of macro environment leading to demand \nslowdown.   \n \n \n Q2FY25 results review (Standalone \u2013 Reported)   \n (INR mn)  Q2FY25  Q2FY24  YoY (%)  Q1FY25  QoQ (%)

Toubro  (LARTOU ) \nBUY  \n  \nAll round perf ormance \u2026   \nAbout the stock: Larsen & Toubro (L&T) is India\u2019s largest engineering & \nconstruction (E&C) company, with interest in EPC projects, hi -tech manufacturing \nand services. The company primarily operates in infrastructure, heavy engineering, \ndefence engineering, power, hydrocarbon, services business segments  \n\u2022 Infrastructure segment contributes ~ 50% to consolidated revenue followed \nby services (~ 29%) and international markets  (40% of backlog from \ninternational markets)   \nQ2FY25 performance:  Given a seasonally weak quarter, the company managed to \nreport \u20b9 80,045 crore order inflows  (OI) up 13% sequentially and degrowth of 10% \nYoY,  albeit  very high base , mainly led by international markets  (63% of OI) . The \ncurrent backlog stands at  \u20b9510,402  crore , up 7% from Q4FY24 . Strong execution in \nthe energy projects segment (up 31% YoY) and infrastructure segment (revenues \nup 30% YoY) space led to consolidated revenue growing by 21% YoY at \u20b9 61,555 \ncrore. Consolidated EBIDTA margins came in at 10. 3% down 70 bps  YoY. Positive \nsurprise also came in from the expansion of 60 bps margins in the core Project & \nmanufacturing segment at 6%. \nInvestment Rationale  \n\u2022 Backlog growth of 1 3% YoY renders strong visibility:  The company has a \ncurrent order backlog of \u20b9510,402 crore  up 1 3% YoY. The execution trends \nof Q 2FY25, especially in infra , hydrocarbon and precision engineering \nspace clearly indicated execution momentum which will help the company \neasily meet its revenue guidance.  Given the prospects of \u20b9 8.1 lakh crore, \nL&T expects to meets OI growth guidance for FY25E. Overall we expect \nrevenues and PAT to grow at CAGR of 14. 7% and 15. 1% over FY24 -FY26E.  \n\u2022 Strong Focus on ROE to create value : L&T has reached ROE of ~ 16% \nand anticipates  the same to reach 18% as per their strategic plan . The \ncompany is banking on improvement of 1% each from 3 catalysts  like a) \nBreakeven  of Hyder abad Metro, b) Improvement in P&M segment margins \nand c) increasing payouts in forms of higher dividends or buybacks.  \nRating and Target Price  \n\u2022 Securing OI near the guidance range , despite an unusually large Q2FY24 \nbase speaks of the diversity of the company\u2019s operations. We believe given \nthe backlog growth and pick up in execution there remains a strong \nprobability of a beat on the revenue growth guidance. With continued \nfocus on improvement of overall return ratios and aspiration of 18% ROE \nby 2026 looks a realistic one. We mainta in BUY  rating  with target of \u20b9 \n4262.  \n \n \n \nParticulars (\u20b9 Crore) FY22 FY23 FY24 5-Year CAGR \n(FY18-FY23) FY25E FY26E 2-Year CAGR \n(FY24E-FY26E) \nNet Sales 1,01,000.4        1,10,501.0     1,26,235.9     11.1% 1,45,147.8           1,66,039.7                14.7%\nEBITDA 9,055.5               9,294.7            9,684.5            5.5% 11,642.1               13,779.7                   19.3%\nEBITDA Margin (%) 9.0                       8.4                    7.7                    8.0                          8.3                              \nAdj.

Management expects export market recovery to be gradual over the \ncoming quarters.  \n\uf06e At the EICMA, the company recently unveiled its first EV motorcycle, the flying \nflea, which is likely to go in to production in FY26 . \n \nValuation and view  \nWe factor in a  7% volume CAGR for RE over FY25 -27E. We expect margins to largely \nremain stable from hereon as any benefit from improving mix (higher spares and \napparel sales) is likely to be invested by RE in demand  generation activities.  Overall, \nwe expect RE to deliver an 11% earnings CAGR over FY25 -27E. Given the expected \nslower earnings growth, we see no reason for the stock to trade at premium \nvaluations.

This is likely to be a function of its new launches, good \navailability of all mode ls and increased promotional act ivities to drive consumer \ninterest. While r ural markets ( estimated 1/3rd contribution to RE\u2019s mix) are seeing \ngrowth,  urban demand remains moderate . \n\uf06e Festival  retails  have been good for RE due to a) ne w product/variant launches , b) \npromotional activities , c) increased dealer funding, and  d) incentive program for \ndealers. Strong festive retails led to a sharp reduction in inventory to less than \nthree weeks.  \n\uf06e Product level interventions in 2Q included the launch of the Guerilla 450 on the \nSherpa platform. Other variant launches included a feature -rich Classic 350cc and \nupgraded Standard B ullet 350 . Standard Bullet was launched in battalion black \ncolor on the J -platform , which has been well received by custo mers in its strong \nmarkets like Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, and UP. \n\uf06e Focus on growth over profitability : Management has reiterated that they would \ncontinue to focus on demand generation (growth) over profitability. They have \nindicated that they are not fixated on margins but would work on absolute \nprofitability. They would target to give a much better value proposition to \ncustomers , thereby driving customer excitement for their products. Margins are \nlikely to be supported by improved exports mix, benign input costs and new \nlaunches.  \n\uf06e 2Q other expenses were high due to its higher marketing spends  (launch related \ncosts ). Apart from this, there was an added expense of INR120m  for warehousing , \nas management wanted good availability of all its models in key reg ions during \nthe festive period. We do not consider warehousing cost s as a one-off given that \nRE intends to use this facility every time ahead of the festive season. Other \nexpenses are likely to remain elevated going forward as  1) the management \nwould conti nue to focus on demand generation activities , 2) EICMA and \nMotoverse events are scheduled in 3Q, and 3) incentive payout s to dealers would \nhappen in 3Q.  Eicher Motors  \n  \n13 November 2024  5 \n \n\uf06e EIM is focusing on promotional activities through print, radio and digital media . \nThis is expected to c ontinue after the festival season to help generate demand . \n\uf06e Retail e xports grew 12% YoY in 2Q (20% YoY in 1HFY25) , ahead of wholesales \ngrowth. There would be a change in the emission norms in export markets to OBD \n2 (B) from Jan\u201925, hence  the company would abstain  from build ing up inventory in \nthese markets. Region -wise demand trends are as follows: 1) Europe continues to \nsee demand weakness and is likely to see gradual revival in coming quarters . 2) \nMarkets in Latin America like Argentina and Columbia are still seeing some \nweakness. While it has  a CKD plant there, demand is still not positive. Further, \ngiven the restricted quota issue in Brazil, EIM has started its 2nd CKD plant in \nBrazil.  3) Aust ralia, which is a good market for RE, has been facing weak demand \nin the past few quarters due to rising interest rates; however, it is now seeing a \ngood demand revival . 4) Thailand is also seeing a weak demand environment as \nbanks are tightening more and more . 5) In SAARC, EIM has recently entered \nNepal , which has stabilized now. It has now entered Bangladesh in 2Q and despite \nmacro issues, EIM is seeing a huge order backlog from this region. Overall, the \nmanagement expects export market recovery to be gra dual over the coming \nquarters.  \n\uf06e Bear 650cc and Classic 650cc were showcased at the EICMA show. Bear would be \nretailed in markets like India/America/EU,  while Classic 650cc would be launched \nin UK/EU initially and later would see India launch.  \n\uf06e At the EICMA, the company recently unveiled its first EV motorcycle, the flying \nflea, which is likely to go in to production from FY26 onward.  \n\uf06e Non -motorcycle segment (accessories, spare parts and apparels) posted stable \ngrowth. RE opened an exclusive apparel store in Pun e. \n\uf06e Finance penetration stood at 61 -62%.  \n\uf06e Annual production capacity stands at 1.2m and it can even go up  to 1.4m, with \nminimal capex through debottlenecking.  \n \nVECV update  \n\uf06e 2HFY25 CV dem and is expected to see a revival, as per management . 1HFY25 \nremain ed subdued due to elections, delay in tenders and monsoons.  \n\uf06e In 2QFY25 , VECV grew 6.2%  YoY (vs. industry decline of 10.8%  YoY).  \n\uf06e Segmental trends: 1) it is now market leader in the LMD segment (5 -18T) with a \nmarket share of 36.5% ; 2) in HD segment, its market share has improved to \n10.2% .  \n\uf06e Exports grew  12.2% YoY despite disruptions in traditional markets.  Spare parts \ndivision saw 27% YoY growth.  \n\uf06e It has signed an MoU for deployment of 500 Eicher Pro 6055 LNG trucks with \nBaidyanath LNG.  \n\uf06e VECV EBITDA margin declined  70bp YoY ( -50bp QoQ) at 7.1 %. Margins remain \nunder pressure as VECV focuses on market share gains amid rising competition . \n \n \n  Eicher Motors  \n  \n13 November 2024  6 \n \nValuation and view  \n\uf06e RE no longer an affordable cruiser bike: After reporting a solid 26.5% CAGR over \nthe last couple of years, RE has now surpassed  its previous peak achieved in FY18. \nIn essence, RE has actually posted only a  1% volume CAGR since FY18. Given that \nRE forms almost 88% of this segment, the entire 250cc+ segment has seen a \nsimilar trend -  the entire 250cc+ industry has posted just 2% volume CAGR in the \nsame period. The primary reason is  the substantial price increase in the industry. \nFor instance, RE bikes have seen as much as a 50% price increase over FY18 -24. \nThus, RE  is no longer an \u201caffordable\u201d bike for cruiser enthusiasts, as was the case \na few years back.  \n\uf06e RE faces rising competitive intensity : Until FY23, RE was largely the sole player \nwith negligible competition in the 350cc+ cruiser segment. However, we have now seen a significant  increase in competitive intensity in the segment after the \nlaunch of new models from the Hero -Harley tie-up and th e Bajaj- Triumph tie -up \nin India. T hese peers target ramp ing up the capacity of these models to 10k per \nmonth over the next couple of months. For the first time in its history, RE is now facing credible competition , which is likely to limit its volume growt h in the \ncoming years.   \n\uf06e State -wise analysis reveals that RE has limited outperformance avenues: Our \nstate- wise analysis reveals that top 12 states contribute to about 76% of RE\u2019s \nvolumes, and this has remained stable for the last four years.  It is importan t to \nhighlight that in as many as 19 states, RE\u2019s market share has now reached double -\ndigit levels, and in almost 11 states, it breached even the 20% mark. We, hence \nbelieve that RE has limited avenues to materially outperform domestic industry \ngrowth from  hereon, as: 1) it seems to have reached fairly high market share in \nkey markets; 2) some of the other large motorcycle markets are yet to be \nupgraded to the cruiser segment in a big way; and 3) competition intensifies with \neach passing year.  \n\uf06e Can the new 4 50cc platform be a big growth driver ? We do  not think so : RE has \nrecently launched its Himalayan  range  on the all- new 450cc platform . We also \nunderstand that RE is expected to launch new variants on th is platform in the \ncoming quarters , which is currently driving positive investor sentiment.  The \ncritical point to understand is whether this platform can help RE garner incremental new customers or it gives existing RE customers a good upgrade \noption. Our view on this is that the 450cc platform with different form factors is \nunlikely to be a material growth driver for RE going forward.  If this were to be the \ncase, its own 500cc platform could have emerged as a strong upgrade option even earlier. However, we have seen that the 500cc segment has traditionally nev er \nbeen a volume driver for RE , and RE\u2019s sweet spot in India has always been in the \n350cc segment.   \n\uf06e Export retai ls improving, with wholesales catch ing up gradually : RE is focus ing \non creating an affordable leisure biking  segment in the 250 -650cc range and in \nthe USD3 -7k price bracket . Globally, the size of the 250 -650cc segment is ~1m \nannually, dominated by the sports/street biking  segment. Exports from India are \nover 0.5m annually for the premium seg ment (excluding RE, over 150cc). It is now \nfocusing on ramping up supplies of newly refreshed RE Himalayan so that it can launch it in export geographies. It  is focusing on developing the LatAm and the Eicher Motors  \n  \n13 November 2024  7 \n \nSouth East Asian markets similar to how it developed the Indian market. We \nestimate  an 11% CAGR in export volum es over FY25 -27E.  \n\uf06e Valuation and view : We maintain our FY25/FY26 EPS estimates . We have factored \nin a 7% volume CAGR over FY25 -27E for RE. We now  expect margins to largely \nremain stable from hereon as any benefit from improving mix (higher spares and \napparel sales) is likely to be passed on to demand generation activities .

.\n\uf0d8Non -interest income forthe quarter stood atINR 114,827 Mn, agrowth of7.2%YoY (+7.6%QoQ) .Fee income forQ2FY25stood atINR\n81.4Bn, anincrease of17.3%YoY (+15.5%QoQ), driven primarily bythird -party distribution products, which saw a32.0%increase .Net\ntrading and mark -to-market gain stood atINR 2.9Bnasagainst INR 2.2BninQ1FY25(vsagain ofINR 10.4BninQ2FY24).\n\uf0d8The cost -to-income ratio forthe quarter was 40.6%,animprovement of43bps QoQ (-18bps QoQ) .Operating expenses forQ2FY25were\nINR 168.9Bn,anincrease of9.7%QoQ ledbyhigher staff expenses .\nAsset Quality remained largely stable QoQ :\n\uf0d8The GNPA, asofSeptember 30,2024 ,stood at1.36%ofthe gross advances (1.19%excluding NPAs inthe agricultural segment) asagainst\n1.33%asofJune 30,2024 (1.16%excluding NPAs inthe agricultural segment) .The net NPAs were 0.41%during the quarter vs.0.39%asof\nJune 30,2023 .Slippages forthequarter stood atINR 78Bnasagainst INR 79BninQ1FY25.\n\uf0d8The recoveries and upgrades were INR 36.0Bn,and the write -offs were INR 29.0Bnduring thequarter .\n\uf0d8The total credit cost ratio was 43bps inQ2FY25ascompared to49bps inQ2FY24(vs.42bps inQ1FY25).HDFCB\u2019s credit cost has been\nrelatively stable, with proactive provisioning continuing, especially around risk segments such asMSME and agriculture .\n\uf0d8The Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) stood atacomfortable level of69.9%during the quarter .\n\uf0d8The bank continues tohold provisions onINR 608 BnasofSeptember 30,2024 ,which includes contingent provisions ofINR 138 Bn.\nSome provisions related totheAlternate Investment Fund (AIF) were released due toregulatory clarifications, resulting inareduction in\ncontingent provisions compared totheprevious quarter .\nKey Concall Highlights :\n\uf0d8HDFCB added 240 new branches during Q2FY25,bringing the total forYTD -FY25to350 branches sofar.The focus remains onexpanding\ninto under -served areas and densifying inurban centres tocapture more customer deposits and credit growth opportunities .\n\uf0d8HDFCB's loan -to-deposit ratio had surged to110.0%following the merger with HDFC Ltd.The bank istargeting tobring itdown to\nhistorical levels (mid -80s)within two tothree years, driven byanaccelerated deposit mobilization effort and calibrated lending growth .\n\uf0d8The bank isawaiting final regulations from the RBI regarding overlaps inlending with group entities, which may affect HDB Financials'\nlisting timeline .However, the bank remains ontrack forthe planned IPO, which must becompleted bySeptember 2025 E.\n\uf0d8HDFCB has been selective ingrowing itsretail credit, particularly inthe unsecured segment, where the bank has intentionally slowed\ngrowth toensure portfolio quality remains strong .The bank's retail GNPA stood atalow 0.8%,reflecting prudent risk management .\n\uf0d8Inthe CRB segment, HDFCB has experimented with pricing changes, adjusting rates by10-25bps over the last sixmonths .However,\ndemand inthis segment has shown high elasticity, meaning that even small rate increases can reduce demand .The competition from\nlegacy banks, particularly public sector banks offering lower rates, has made itdifficult forHDFC Bank toincrease loan pricing inthe CRB\nspace .\n\uf0d8HDFCB observed some seasonality initsagricultural lending, where traditionally, slippages reduce inthe second quarter after aheavier\nfirst quarter .However, this quarter saw aslight deviation from historical trends, likely due torecent forays into deeper geographical\nareas and newer small and marginal farmer lending segments .\nValuation and view :\nHDFCB\u2019s Q2FY25performance reflects cautious yetstable growth, driven byhealthy deposit mobilization, conservative lending, and afocus\nonmaintaining asset quality .Thebank\u2019s strategy toreduce itsC/D ratio tohistorical levels and careful calibration ofwholesale and\ncommercial lending amid competitive pricing pressures are the key engines incoming quarters .The gradual reduction ofC/D ratio,\nimproving liquidity, and ongoing branch expansion are settodrive long -term growth .The planned IPO ofHDB Financial Services isalso\nexpected togenerate additional capital .\nWe expect CAGR inNIIat13.7%,PPOP at11.3%,and PAT at13.3%over FY24\u201326E.HDFCB iscurrently trading at2.5x/2.4xforFY25E/FY26E\nP/ABV, respectively .We expect the valuation tosee are-rating driven byimprovements indeposit growth and the post -deployment of\nexcess liquidity through the repayment ofborrowings .We value the bank's standalone business at2.4xFY26EP/ABV (earlier 2.2x)toarrive\natavaluation ofINR 1,704 per share .Thesubsidiaries\u2019 value stands atINR 230,taking the total value ofHDFCB toINR 1,934 (earlier INR\n1,860 per share), implying anupside of11.9%from the current price .Accordingly, wemaintain our rating of\u201cACCUMULATE\u201d onthe shares\nofHDFC Bank Ltd.4 Page\nHDFC Bank Ltd.India Equity Institutional Research  II Q2FY25 \u2013Result Update

research5@krchoksey.com, +91-22-6696 5408Key Concall Highlights :\nLower end ofgrowth guidance revised ;EBIT margin guidance remains intact\n\uf0d8HCL Tech has revised itsrevenue growth guidance to3.5%-5.0%CCYoY, with asimilar outlook forthe services segment, while EBIT\nmargins areexpected toremain inthe range of18.0\u201319.0%.\n\uf0d8This guidance does not factor inpotential revenue from the acquisition ofcertain assets from HPE\u2019s Communication Technology Group\n(CTG), expected toclose inDecember 2024 .\n\uf0d8We anticipate strong growth inthe product business, improved utilization rates, reductions insubcontractor costs, and lower SG&A\nexpenses, which arelikely todrive margin improvements inH2FY25E,though partially offset bywage hike pressures .\nTCV remains muted, Clients added inlarger bracket\n\uf0d8TCV forthe quarter stood atUSD 2,218Mn, down 44.1%YoY (+13.2%QoQ), indicating moderation ingrowth inthe near tomedium term\nand the need formega deals todrive revenue growth inFY26E.\n\uf0d8The company reported the addition offour new clients each inthe USD 50mn+ and USD 20mn+ categories onasequential basis .\n\uf0d8However, the company experienced anet reduction offive clients inthe USD 10mn+ category, along with adecrease oftwo clients in\nthe USD 5mn+ segment .\nHCLTech\u2019s AIforce gains momentum, Accelerating GenAI adoption and transforming services\n\uf0d8HCLTech\u2019s AIcapabilities arebecoming integral tomost deals, with itsGenAI platform, AIForce, seeing widespread adoption forservice\ntransformation .\n\uf0d8Currently, the platform isgaining traction with over 25clients, with atarget toexpand to50.The company\n\uf0d8has secured key wins inGenAI -related projects, which aredriving technology change and reducing technology debt across industries .\n\uf0d8The company\u2019s AIForce platform, integrated with Anthropic Cloud through Amazon Bedrock, isalso part ofstrategic collaborations\nwith AWS and Google Cloud, aimed ataccelerating GenAI adoption .\n\uf0d8Anotable project includes the deployment ofHCLTech\u2019s Enterprise AIFoundry tobuild and operationalize AImodels that enhance\naftermarket sales operations foramajor U.S.-based automotive client .\n\uf0d8The company continues toleverage AItoreduce operational timelines, improve efficiency, and displace competitors inGenAI -related\ncontracts .\nInterim dividend announced ;Payment setforOctober 30\n\uf0d8HCLTech\u2019s Board ofDirectors has declared aninterim dividend ofINR 12per share .The record date has been confirmed asOctober 22,\n2024 ,with the dividend payment scheduled forOctober 30,2024 .\nHeadcount shrinks, Attrition inches up;Focus shifts tospecialized hiring\n\uf0d8Despite strong revenue growth and significant fresher hiring, HCLTech\u2019s total headcount for Q2FY25decreased by780 employees,\nbringing theworkforce to218,621.\n\uf0d8The company added 2,932 freshers during Q2FY25.However, theattrition rate edged upslightly by10bps to12.9%.\n\uf0d8HCLTech isincreasingly focusing onworkforce quality, aiming toshift itshiring strategy towards specialized skills, particularly inareas\nlike data and AI,rather than purely expanding based onrevenue growth .\n\uf0d8The company plans phased wage hikes over Q3FY25and Q4FY25,which areexpected toimpact margins by65-80bps inQ3,followed by\nanadditional 50-60bps impact inQ4.\n\uf0d8InIndia, salary increments will average 7.0%,with top performers receiving increases between 12.0%and 15.0%.\n\uf0d8HCLTech has factored insimilar furloughs tolast year, based onongoing client discussions and evolving priorities .\nValuation and view :\nHCL Tech delivered robust results for Q2FY25,with earnings surpassing our expectations, driven bysignificant growth initsservice and\nsoftware sectors .While management expressed optimism regarding the improving demand landscape across various verticals, itremains\ncautious amid ongoing uncertainty and volatility .We maintain apositive outlook onHCL Tech's ability toachieve the upper end ofitsrevenue\nguidance, supported byincreased discretionary spending and broad -based growth across verticals, including apotential revival inthe BFSI\nsegment influenced byinterest rate cuts, and strong growth inthe HCL software business projected forQ3FY25E.However, muted deal total\ncontract values (TCVs), challenges inthe aerospace and automotive sectors, and aweak near -term outlook forthe software business may\nhinder growth momentum .\nInlight ofthese developments, wehave slightly increased our FY26EEPS toINR 72.6(previously :INR 72.5)and increased our P/Emultiple to\n26.0x(previously :23.0x)due toimproved discretionary spending, strong service revenue performance, and enhancing digital capabilities .\nAsaresult, wehave raised our target price toINR 1,887 (previously INR 1,668).\nHCLTech\u2019s historical Revenue/ PAT growth forFY21-FY24stands at13.4%/12.1%,respectively, which islargely inline with our projections for\nFY24-FY26E.However, the recent rally inthe share price has resulted inHCL Tech trading atanall-time high 1-Year Forward P/Emultiple of\n29.4x,well above the three -year average of18.1x.\nWhile our forecasts are consistent with the company's historical growth trajectory, the recent surge in HCL Tech's share pric es,fueled by \nexpectations of increased discretionary spending, has led to stretched valuations. This raises concerns about the sustainabil ityof these \nelevated levels. Consequently, we revise our rating on HCL Tech from \"ACCUMULATE\" to \"HOLD.\"HCL Technologies Ltd.India Equity Institutional Research  II Q2FY25 \u2013Result Update             II   15thOct

With US$ 20 -25/t reduction in coking \ncoal costs  (company guidance ), margin can see uptick starting from Q3.  \nKey triggers through FY26 : (a) Ramp -up of  5mtpa Vijayanagar and 1mtpa BPSL \nexpansion s over FY25 and FY26, (b) lower iron ore costs with planned ramp -up of \nnew mines in Karnataka, Odisha and Goa. Besides better quality, it will help lower \nlogistics cost , (c) reduction in net debt initially with inventory release (Rs 15 bn-20bn) \nand then with improvement in profitability in FY26 with delivery on expansions . \nFY24 -27E EBITDA CAGR at 16% : We cut FY25E EBITDA  by 15%, factor ing in \nweaker Q2 and Q3 than our expectations at the start of Q2. With the commissioning \nof 5mtpa BF further derisking the Vijayanagar expansion, we tweak FY26E/FY27E \nEBITDA by 1% -2%. We now bake in a ~1 6% EBITDA CAGR over FY24 -FY27E, \nmodelling in a volume ramp -up of ~7mt over three years to 32.5mt by FY27. We \nbuild in margin improvement from Rs 10.2k/t in FY24 to Rs 12. 9k/t by FY27.  \nMaintain HOLD : We raise TP to Rs 975 (from Rs 925) with changes to our \nestimates and roll forward valuation to Sep\u201925 (from Jun\u201925). Despite optimistic \nestimates and target 1Y fwd EV/EBITDA of 7.0x to allow for multiple expansion \nduring the early recovery phase, our TP yields just 3% upside. With higher target net \ndebt to EBITDA threshold of 3.75x, JSTL is more vulnerable to any change in \ncyclical outlook  than its peers .

JSTL earned EBITDA margin of Rs 8,196/t for consolidated \noperations, Rs 9,266/t for India operations and Rs 8,765/t for standalone operations.  \nStandalone beat : Standalone EBITDA at Rs  46bn was Rs  10bn higher than our \nestimates due to higher sales volume of 5.3mt (vs 5.1mt) and higher EBITDA margin of \nRs 8.8k/t (vs Rs  7.1k/t).  \nSeveral moving parts to standalone EBITDA margin:  Higher EBITDA margin was \nthe result of several additional deltas beyond lower steel price and coking coal costs. \nApparent standalone realisation was down Rs 6.1k/t QoQ, higher than Rs 3k/t reduction \nin steel prices. This was partly due to the absence of export sale of iron ore after \ncompleting committed quantities out of Jajong mine in Q1. Similarly cost reduction was \nmuch higher at Rs 5.5k/t beyond the US$ 27/t reduction in coking coal costs due to the \nbene fit of lower taxes on iron ore, lower iron ore production from high -cost Jajong mine \n(total iron or e production reduced to 5.1mt in Q2 from 6.1mt in Q1), lower thermal coal \ncosts, as well as lower loss on valuation of inventory.  \nDomestic sales impacted by elevated Chinese exports : Domestic sales clocked 1% \nYoY growth in Q2, significantly lower than 11.6% consumption growth in India . JSTL \nlost market share to imports in  both flat products and Retail segment  (down 14% YoY) . \nValue -added sales product ( VASP ) share of total sales was at 60% . \nExports weak : Export s fell 43% YoY and constituted just 7% of sales mix , down from \n10% in Q1.  \nBPSL miss:  Q2 EBITDA at Rs  4bn was down 36% QoQ on the back of 35% decline in \nEBITDA margin to Rs  5.8k/t.  Besides lower sales realisation, shutdown costs and \nadditional costs for industrial gases impacted the profitability.   \nNet income miss : Was attributable to h igher effective tax rate at 48.80% for Q2FY25 \ndue to losses at certain domestic and overseas  subsidiaries . \n  JSW  STEEL   \n \n \n \n \nEQUITY RESEARCH  3 28 October 2024  \n \nFig 2 \u2013 Quarterly performance  \n(Rs bn)  Q2FY25  Q1FY25  QoQ (%)  Q1FY2 4 YoY (%)  H1FY25  H1FY24  YoY(%)  \nConsolidated P&L          \nRevenue from operations  397 429 (7.6) 446 (11.0)  826 868 (4.8) \nEBITDA  54 55 (1.3) 79 (31.1)  109 149 (26.7)  \nAdj EBITDA  54 55 (1.3) 79 (31.1)  109 149 (26.7)  \nEBIT  32 33 (4.0) 59 (46.0)  65 110 (41.2)  \nPBT before exceptionals  11 14 (18.0)  40 (71.7)  25 75 (66.4)  \nPAT before minorities (adjusted)  1 9 (92.8)  34 (98.2)  9 58 (84.0)  \nNet income to owners  4 8 (48.0)  28 (84.1)  13 51 (74.8)  \nEPS (Rs)  2 3 (48.1)  11 (84.2)  5.3 21.1 (75.0)  \nTax rate (%)  48.8 37.2 - 39.5 - 41.4 35.5 - \nAdj EBITDA break down          \nStandalone  46 43 8.6  69 (32.7)  89 118 (24.2)  \nBPSL  4 7 (35.7)  7 (42.1)  11 14 (24.0)  \nJSW Steel Colour Coated  3 4 (7.6) 4 (17.0)  7 8 (11.0)  \nOverseas subsidiaries  0 0 (177.4)  1 (170.9)  6 2 235.4  \nOthers  1 1 (59.4)  (2) 127.5  2 9 (76.3)  \nConsolidated  54 55 (1.3) 79 (31.1)  109 149 (26.7)  \nStandalone operational parameters          \nProduction (mt)  5.8 5.3 8.9  5.4 6.9  11.1 10.8 2.1  \nSales (mt)  5.3 5.1 4.1  5.4 (2.0) 10.4 10.3 0.5  \nApparent realisation (Rs'000/t)  57.2 63.3 (9.7) 61.5 (7.1) 60.2 63.6 (5.4) \nAdj EBITDA (Rs'000/t)  8.8 8.4 4.3  12.8 (31.3)  8.6 11.4 (24.5)  \nBPSL operational parameters          \nProduction (mt)  0.8 0.8 5.1  0.8 6.5  1.6 1.5 6.0  \nSales (mt)  0.7 0.8 (1.3) 0.8 (7.5) 1.5 1.5 0.0  \nApparent realisation (Rs'000/t)  66.2 74.2 (10.7)  72.7 (8.9) 70.2 75.8 (7.3) \nEBITDA (Rs'000/t)  5.8 8.9 (34.8)  9.3 (37.5)  7.4 9.7 (24.0)  \nStandalone+BPSL operational parameters          \nProduction (mt)  6.6 6.1 8.4  6.2 6.8  12.7 12.4 2.6  \nSales (mt)  6.0 5.8 3.4  6.2 (2.7) 11.9 11.8 0.4  \nApparent realisation (Rs'000/t)  58.3 64.7 (9.9) 63.0 (7.4) 61.4 65.2 (5.7) \nEBITDA (Rs'000/t)  8.4 8.5 (0.8) 12.3 (31.8)  8.4 11.2 (24.5)  \nSource: Company, BOBCAPS Research  \n  JSW  STEEL   \n \n \n \n \nEQUITY RESEARCH  4 28 October 2024  \n \nFig 3 \u2013 JSTL\u2019s India sales declined sequential ly on \nweaker exports and imp ort competition    Fig 4 \u2013 EBITDA margin flat QoQ  \n   \n \nSource: Company, BOBCAPS Research    Source: Company, BOBCAPS Research  \n \nFig 5 \u2013 Consolidated EBITDA: Stable at a lower level   Fig 6 \u2013 Net debt increase d due  to working capital and \nacquisition  \n  \n \nSource: Company, BOBCAPS Research   Source: Company, BOBCAPS Research  \nKey guidance  \nSharp growth uptick in H2 : Implied H2 production  and sales growth guidance works \nout to 12% and 16% YoY  growth, respectively , based on the retained FY25 guidance of \n28.4mt/27mt.

Conversely, key upside risks to our estimates are favourable \nchanges in global dynamics, leading to higher prices and margins than assumed.   \n\u25aa The company is exposed to the risk of delays in ramping up its aggressive capital \ninvestment plan, which could hurt earnings growth. It aims to complete 5mtpa of \nexpansion in FY25, to expand its India capacity to 3 5.7mtpa and then further to \n42mtpa by Sep\u201927. Conversely, ramp -up of these expansion projects faster than \nour assumptions represents an upside risk.  \n\u25aa Considering its aggressive growth policy, large capital investment plan over FY24 -\nFY25 and significantly higher trailing net debt to LTM EBITDA ratio of 3. 5x as at \nSep\u201924, JSTL is relatively more vulnerable than its peers in the event of a \nprotracted downturn in the steel cycle.

At \nstandalone level it is India\u2019s largest tractor manufacturer ( 41.6% FY2 4 market \nshare) & 2nd largest CV, 4th largest PV maker ( 27.2%, 10.9 % FY2 4 market share)  \nQ2FY25 Results:  M&M reported healthy performance in Q 2FY25 . On standalone \nbasis, topline for the quarter came in at \u20b927 ,553  crore (up 1 3.3% YoY) with \nautomotive segment volumes growing 9% YoY at 2.31 lakh units and tractor sales \nvolume at 93K units (up 3.7% YoY). EBITDA in Q2FY25 came in at \u20b93,950 crore with \ncorresponding EBITDA margins at 14.3% (down 54 bps QoQ). Resultant PAT for \nQ2FY25 stood at \u20b93,841 crore (up 11.3% YoY).  \nInvestment Rationale:  \n\u2022 New product launches in offerings augurs well for M&M in l ong term : \nM&M has  sustained its revenue market leadership in SUV category , \nbolstered  by successful launches like Thar Roxx, XUV 3XO, XUV 700  & \nScorpio -N, which have quickly resonated with customers, driven by \ncutting -edge technology & value  offering . Amid healthy  demand for SUV  \nspace , M&M plans  aggressive product launch  strategy,  including  9-ICE \nSUV\u2019s (6 new ICE models, 3 refreshes incl. XUV 3XO)  and 7 BEV\u2019s by 2030  \nwith  two new  models  namely  XEV 9e and BE 6e to be unveiled  in current  \nmonth . To cater  these  new  age technology  vehicles,  M&M has outlined an \nambitious capex plan  of ~\u20b9 2 7,000 crore over FY25 -27E with a primarily \nfocus  on product development and capacity expansions. Of this, \u20b912,000 \ncrore  is earmarked specifically for PV-EV space , with the goal of increas ing \nits BEV portfolio to 20% -30% of its SUV models by 202 7. It has retained its \nguidance of mid to high teens volume growth in SUV space for FY25 E.  \n \n\u2022 Tailwinds in tractor industry  will drive growth for M &M: Above normal  \nmonsoon  at 108%  of LPA,  healthy  water  reservoir  levels  & increase  in \ngovernment  spending  in rural  space  are expected  to benefit  the domestic  \ntractor  industry  which  is anticipated  to achieve  its long -term  volume  CAGR  \nof 5-7% starting  FY25 E.

On standalone basis, \ntopline for the quarter came in at \u20b927,553 crore , up 13.3% Yo Y with \nautomotive segment volumes growing 9% YoY at 2.31 lakh units and \ntractor sales volume at 93 k units , up 3.7% YoY. EBITDA in Q2FY25 came in \nat \u20b93,950 crore with EBITDA margins at 14.3% , down 54 bps QoQ but up \n172 bps YoY. Resultant PAT stood at \u20b93,841 crore (up 11.3% YoY).  \n \n\u2022 Automotive segment EBIT margins remained flat at 9.5% on a QoQ basis, \nwhile Farm Equipment segment margins were at 17.5% (down 100 bps \nQoQ but up 150 bps YoY). Margin performance at M&M remained neutral.   \n \n\u2022 On the SUV side there was an 18% YoY growth driven by new launches.  It \naspires to grow mid to high teens in FY25E amidst domestic PV industry \ngrowth pegged at <5%, on the back of aggressive product launches. It is \naiming to launch 23 new vehicle models by 2030. This includes 9 new ICE \nSUVs, within which there are 3 Mid cycle enhancements. Additionally, it \nwill also launch 7 new Battery Electric Vehicles models and 7 new LCV \nmodels including 5 ICE and 2 Electric Vehicle variants.  \nQ2FY25 Earnings Conference Call Highlights : \n\u2022 Automotive Performance:  M&M retained its leadership position in the SUV \nsegment in revenue terms, achieving a market share of 21.9%, up by 30 \nbps QoQ in Q2FY25. It retained the guidance of mid to high teen volume \ngrowth rate in FY25 E, driven by new launches such as XUV3XO and Thar \n5 door. M&M had a very good festive season and is looking to keep the \npositive momentum going forward. For the medium term , M&M aims to \nreach EBIT margin of 10% in the auto segment.  \n \n\u2022 Capacity outlook:  As previously guided, M&M has achieved monthly \ncapacity of 54K units from 49K units of which 9.5K unit capacity is for Thar \nwhich is fungible and would increase to 11.5K units in the next 6 months. \nCurrently, M&M is not planning for capacity addition in ICE and have \nguided for 1,00,000 units per year capacity for EV production in Phase 1.  \n \n\u2022 LCV:  M&M has retained its top position in the LCV <3.5T with a market \nshare of 52.3%, up by 1 40bps QoQ in Q2FY25. About 65% LCV sales comes \nfrom the rural market, which did not show signs of improvement due to \nlack of mundi arrivals. Going forward M&M is positive for the demand to \nimprove as Mundi arrivals have gone up by 20% in October.  \n \n\u2022 Electric Portfolio:  M&M has recently announced the launch of its new EVs \ncalled the Electric origin SUVs under which it will unveil two models, BE 6e \nand XEV 9e, by end of November and will launch in early CY2025.  \n \n\u2022 Farm Equipment : M&M is seeing green shoots in tractor segment and has \nrevised its guidance of overall tractor industry to grow at ~6 -7% YoY in \nFY25, while expecting ~13-15% growth in H2FY25. It has retained its \nleadership position in the tractor segment with a market share of 42.5% \nthereby gaining 90 bps YoY in Q2FY25. The core tractor PBIT for the \nquarter was at 18.7%.  \n \n\u2022 International Markets:  Overall , the international markets are not doing well \nfor M&M, as challenges are seen in the US markets (11 quarters of farm \nmachinery degrowth) and Turkey (hyper -inflation).  \n \n\u2022 Others:  On the raw material front, large part of commodity prices are \nbenign except on the Natural rubber front (impacting tractor segment) . \nWith a very good festive season, M&M has cleared its inventory which now \nstands below 30 days for auto sector but still needs correction in the \ntractor segment  (however not alarming in nature) . M&M is also optimistic \ntowards marriage season as a trigger for auto sales .     \nICICI Securities | Retail Research   3 ICICI Direct Research  \n Result  Update  | Mahindra & Mahindra  \nKey Tables and Charts  \nExhibit 1:  Quarterly P&L Analysis  \nQ2FY25 Q2FY24 YoY (%) Q1FY25 QoQ (%) Comments\nTotal Operating Income 27,553          24,310     13.3 27,039       1.9Topline came inhealthy and marginally\nahead of expectations amid beat on ASP's\nRaw Material Expenses 20,444          18,379     11.2 19,939       2.5\nEmployee Expenses 1,153             1,126       2.3 1,175          -2\nOther expenses 2,007             1,738       15.4 1,902          5.5Other expenses came inhigher at7.3% of\nsales, up 30 bps QoQ\nEBITDA 3,950             3,066       28.8 4,022          -1.8\nEBITDA Margin (%) 14.3               12.6          172 bps 14.9             -54 bps EBITDA margins came inahead of\nexpectations at 14.3%\nOther income 1,998             2,150       -7.1 352              468.3Other income surprised positively largely\ndriven by dividend received from\nsubsidiaries, associates and JV's\nDepreciation 961                816           17.8 915              5.1\nInterest 55                  33              67 53                4\nTax 1,090             915           19.1 794              37.4\nPAT 3,841             3,452       11.3 2,613          47.0PAT forthequarter grew healthy double\ndigit amid healthy volume growth and\nstable margin profile\nEPS 32.1               28.9          11.3 21.9             47.0\nKey Metrics\nAuto revenues (\u20b9 crore) 21,110          18,406     14.7 18,947       11.4Auto segment revenues were boosted by\nhigher than anticipated ASP's at\u20b99.14\nlakh/unit (up 2% QoQ)\nFES revenues (\u20b9 crore) 6,497             5,920       9.8 8,144          -20.2FES (tractor segment) revenues were\nboosted by4%sequential rise inblended\nASP's at \u20b9 6.96 lakh/unit\n \nSource: Company, ICICI Direct Research  \n \nExhibit 2:  Change in key estimates  \nFY25E FY26E Introduced\n(\u20b9 Crore) Old New % Change Old New % Change FY27E Comments\nRevenue 1,10,902 1,12,661 1.6 1,25,610 1,26,130 0.4 1,37,983Marginally tweaked our estimates.

It produces \ngrey and white cement and ready -mix concrete (RMC).  \n \n\u2022 In Q2FY25, UltraTech's consolidated revenue de -grew 2.4% YoY to Rs. \n15,635cr, with sales volume increasing 4.3% YoY. The de -growth was due to \nweaker cement prices that reduced sales realisation 6.4% YoY.  \n\u2022 Capacity utilisation stood at 68.0% in Q2FY25 compared with 75.0% in \nQ2FY24 (85.0% in Q1FY25).  \n\u2022 EBITDA stood at Rs. 2,018cr, declining 20.9% YoY. EBITDA margin narrowed \n302bps YoY to 12.9% due to lower topline and higher other expenses result-\ning from maintenance costs.  \n\u2022 Consequently, PAT decreased 36.0% YoY to Rs. 820cr, further impacted by  \nhigher interest expenses.  \n\u2022 UltraTech \u2019s muted quarterly performance is attributed to sluggish demand, \nimpacted by extended monsoon season. Nevertheless, the management ex-\npects good monsoons to propel rural demand in the near term.  \nOutlook & Valuation  \nUltraTech had a weak operating performance due to subdued demand and lower \npricing. However, going forward industry growth is expected to pick up driven by \nrural demand along with the government \u2019s thrust on  infrastructure development and \nurbanisation. The company, with its strategic acquisitions and capacity expansion \nplans, is poised to benefit from these emerging opportunities. Hence, we upgrade \nour rating on the stock to BUY based on 20x FY26E EV/EBITDA with a revised \ntarget price of Rs. 12,320.  www.geojit.com   \n  Old estimates  New estimates  Change (%)  \nYear / Rs. cr  FY25E  FY26E  FY25E  FY26E  FY25E  FY26E  \nRevenue  77,999  89,699  75,517  86,845  -3.2 -3.2 \nEBITDA  15,744  19,514  14,159  18,307  -10.1 -6.2 \nMargins (%)  20.2 21.8 18.7 21.1 -145bps  -72bps  \nAdj.
